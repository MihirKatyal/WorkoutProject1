Reverse Cipher Text Transformer
Overview
This Python script implements a basic reverse cipher to transform the contents of a text file into its reversed form. The reverse cipher is a simple encryption technique that inverts the characters of the original message.

Usage
To use the script, run it from the command line with the following syntax:

python wp1.py input_filename output_filename

input_filename: The name of the text file containing the original content.
output_filename: The name of the text file where the reversed content will be saved.
